        <h1> <em>Lobster Thermidor Instructions</em></h1>
            <p> I used a nice <em> light</em> sauce on this <strong>
            iconic</strong>
            special occasion dish--lobster thermidor
            --rather than the thick, cheesy sauce 
            popular in the '80s. Lobster is sweet
            and rich tasting on its own, so the 
            <em>lighter sauce makes so much sense.</em> 
            And what's even better, you can prep
            these ahead of time and just pop 
            them in the oven when your guests
            arrive! <strong>By: John Mitzewich</strong>

        <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 (4 ounce) lobster tails</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced shallots</li>
                <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups diced mushrooms (Optional)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons cognac or brandy</li>
                <li> ½ cup whole milk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons creme fraiche or heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon</li>
                <li>Cayenne pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons fine dried bread crumbs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons melted butter</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <br>
        <h2> <em>Directions</em> </h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut bottom shell of lobster tails using kitchen
                shears along each side where it meets the top 
                shell; do not remove the shell at this point.</li>
                <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over 
                medium-high heat. Place lobster tails cut side 
                down in the butter. Cook, covered, about 3 
                minutes. Turn lobster tails over (they are 
                curved so will lean to 1 side); cover and cook
                1 minute. Lean them to the other side; cover and
                cook 1 minute more.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat. Transfer lobster tails to
                a bowl. Remove any shell pieces from the skillet.</li>
                <li>Place 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over 
                    medium heat; add shallots and pinch of salt. 
                    Cook and stir until pan starts to deglaze and
                    shallots soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add mushrooms;
                    cook stir until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. 
                    Add flour; stir until mushrooms are coated and
                    cook for 2 minutes. Pour in cognac; use a 
                    kitchen torch to flame cognac to burn off 
                    alcohol. This will take just a few seconds. 
                    Add milk; cook and stir until pan is 
                    completely deglazed and milk begins to 
                    thicken and turn bubbly, about 2 minutes.
                    Remove from heat. Stir in creme fraiche. 
                    Let cool.</li>
                <li>Remove lobster meat from the shell, leaving
                    top shell intact. Remove any bits of bottom
                    shell from the meat.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
                    Line a baking pan with crinkled up foil. 
                    Make 4 channel-like indentations in the foil
                    to hold and stabilize the lobster tails as
                    they bake.</li>
                <li>Slice lobster meat down the middle and check
                     for and remove any dark veins. Chop into 
                     1/2-inch pieces. Transfer meat to a mixing 
                     bowl. Add cooled sauce, tarragon, pinch of 
                     salt, and cayenne pepper. Stir gently until
                    well blended.</li>
                <li>Divide mixture among the lobster tail shells;
                     place in prepared foil-lined pan. Sprinkle 
                     each lobster tail with about 1/2 teaspoon 
                     bread crumbs and 1/2 teaspoon grated cheese. 
                     Drizzle melted butter on the stuffed shells.</li>
                <li> Baked in preheated oven until nicely browned 
                    and heated through, about 10 minutes. If you 
                    like, you can turn on the broiler and broil 
                    1 minute until tops are golden and crispy.</li>
            </ol>
